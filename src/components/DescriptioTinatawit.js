              Each nation established its own administrative structure and was
              governed by the king. Three dynasties alternately ruled the
              people. The first Gama dynasty had its central seat in Zmar-Ma
              /Oya area, the second Gemelo dynasty had its central seat in
              Kanfocha/Fofa, the medicine house/Kristian Gandana, and the Mowa
              dynasty had its central seat in Angeri. From the second half of
              the 13th century, Angeri Palace served as the seat and residence
              of the Mowa dynasty until the Yam Empire was absorbed into the
              Central Empire.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until 1894, according to the European calendar, Ababogibo
              (traditionally called Gosasno) led the nation and after him, his
              son, Gerano/Fitaurari Ge/Medhn/, led the nation through
              traditional administration. This king planted modern education in
              1938 AD by bringing what is now known as Fofa Secondary and
              Preparatory School and Fofa Debre Juduk Saheyalem Church from
              Emperor Menelik II in 1888. As a result, the people gave them the
              name Kemni, which means our eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The elders of the tribe explained that in the past, the palace was
              surrounded by three fences, but now there is only one fence near
              the palace. There were 12 different houses in the palace grounds,
              including the food hall, the butcher's house, the tavern, the
              prison, and the king's lodgings. The palace is located 27.8
              kilometers from the capital of the special district, Saja, in the
              southeast direction of Gorumna Angeri. Even today, the places
              where many historical ceremonies and events took place, as well as
              the majestic age-old indigenous trees are living witnesses to its
              antiquity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The palace has three doors, the first is the door for guests who
              come to the king for business, the second is the door for the king
              to enter the palace from his residence, and the third is the door
              for the king to go to the church of George in the palace wall.
              When we look at the design of the house, each one has a meaning,
              the pillar represents the king, the sides / tore / represent the
              tribal leaders, while other parts of the roof represent the
              people, the cross on the top of the pillar shows that they first
              accepted Christianity. If we start from Saja, the capital of the
              special district, after traveling 26.8 km, we will find the
              crossroads that leads to the palace.
            </p>
            <p>
              About one kilometer from the intersection, you will find the place
              where the historical action took place. The name of the place is
              called "Tum Tum". It got its meaning from the word "Msa Tuma/rule"
              in the language of the people, and it is said that there is a cave
              that came inside this place from the palace. It means place.
            </p>

              The rule that was issued during the time of the kings; the border
              issue; In general matters such as invasion, war and foreign
              relations, the representatives of each tribe will make a decision
              through "Astesar/ 12 people represented from different tribes/
              Nantser/ people represented from all tribes/ and Tumtesar/
              Legislature/" and it will be approved by the king at the same
              place and put into action. . The artifacts that are still there
              are witnesses.
            </p>
            <p>
              These are old cedar trees. The flat stones of the king's seat are
              the witnesses. After walking a little further down the hill, we
              will find the first gate of the palace. His name is "Bocho". A
              person who reaches this checkpoint will be asked by the guards
              where he is going. If a messenger is sent to the king and given
              permission to enter, or if they receive a message to enter, they
              will be allowed to enter the palace. We find two flat stones where
              the two guards rest and wait.

              half of the 13th century. In addition, there are evidences that
              testify to the fact that it is very ancient, and these are: - the
              discovery of ancient pottery during the excavation to restore the
              palace house and fence, the fact that the pits of the stone
              basket, which was a toy of the palace people, were full of holes
              due to the internal movement of the stone, the houses were old and
              collapsed due to their long service, and the ruins of the fence.
              Also, the presence of very old indigenous trees, the presence of
              stone cabin platforms made for various services, etc.The place of
              the palace has been used mainly as a palace where different kings

              Mowa dynasty took over and ruled from the second half of the 13th
