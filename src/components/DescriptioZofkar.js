              Artifacts are historical manifestations of a country or ethnic
              group. Artifacts are not only historical manifestations but also
              tourist attractions. Because of this, every country or nation is
              seen as daring to preserve its historical heritage, which is a
              manifestation of its own history, to pass it on to the next
              generation and to introduce it to others. Every ethnic group is
              one of the ethnic groups of Ethiopia. Every ethnic group has its
              own culture, language, history, traditions and cultural heritage
              like all the other ethnic groups of our region. It is a well-known
              fact that the culture, traditions and cultural heritage of the
              nation highlight the identity of the nation and serve as an
              identity that differentiates the nation from other nations.

              The place where the plant stones are located is called "Zofkar".
              The place used to be used for burials before the creation of the
              great and famous religious institutions of the time. It is said
              that the plant stones on the site were worshiped as statues until
              recently. Although the date and time of the beginning of burial at
              the site is not known, it is said that burials were carried out at
              this site during the reign of Bogibo (the last king of Yem).
            </p>
            <p>
              Burials were carried out at this place before 1888, that is,
              before the establishment of the Fofa Debre Daryaalem Church, and
              information sources say that the stones in this area were used as
              a sign at each burial site. As the stones found in the place are
              different in height and thickness, they have different designs in
              shape. Among the plant stones found at the site, the largest one
              is 2.63 meters tall and the smallest one is 51 centimeters tall.
              In total, there are more than 211 plant stones in the place. But
              you should note that the separation of the stones in terms of
              shape and thickness has no other meaning. As the site was a
              separate burial site, the entrance to the site had two plant
              stones known as Kela or "Kema" in the local language. They are
              still there. It is said that the "Mowa" tribes who were mostly
              buried at the site were "Gama", "Haema", "Yesu" and other tribes.
              During the burial, the items used by the deceased, such as tools,
              knives, spears, pottery and other useful materials, are buried
              together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Excavations such as Sanja, pottery and small beads bear witness to
              this. Accordingly, the king's family and tribe occupied the center
              of the burial place while the other tribes were buried in the
              surrounding area. After the burial, a guard was kept for a week to
              prevent the attack of the enemy and other beasts. In general, the
              stone planting ceremony was performed at the door of the deceased.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is said that the installation is done on the 12th day after the
              death of the deceased after the "Bacho" ceremony / the day the
              stone is installed, that is, after the slaughtering ceremony is
              done on the day of Machu sacrifice. Historians say that the
              society stopped burying in this place since 1888, that is, since
              the time when faith institutions like Fofa Debre Yaheyalaem Church
              started to be established.
