              Every nation has its own system of justice and judgment that has
              been passed down for centuries. Among them, Mmilla, Sheni, Reji,
              Lega, Togo, Jiga, and Chalo have traditional judicial and judicial
              systems. If someone says, "I have been wronged, I deserve
              justice," he first presents his case to Mila. If the case is not
              resolved, it will go to the traditional Chalo arbitration for
              Sheni, Reji, Lega, Togo, and Jiga. Chalo's traditional judging is
              held for seven consecutive days from September 17-23, in
              conjunction with the Cross Festival, and cases that have not been
              settled on these days are seen only on April 27 and 28.

              Three chief judges named "Men Gagna", "Aulan Gagna" and "Kon
              Gagna" from the Gaza tribe are appointed to enforce this
              traditional judicial system. In addition, 12 elders from different
              tribes will be named together to oversee the execution of these
              judges' judgments. In this traditional judiciary, although various
              cases are considered, mainly serious crimes without evidence are
              judged. The judging and the Hebo (cross) dance are held side by
              side. Thousands of people attend this traditional judging and Hebo
              dance. The judging will be held at a place called Chalo Tuna,
              located 38.8 kilometers from Ksaja city, in Shosher Almama and
              Semuawasho kebeles.
