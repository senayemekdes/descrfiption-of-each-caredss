              Mount Bor is located 32 kilometers away from Saja, the capital of
              the special district, and borders four kebals, namely Shosher,
              Almama, Semu Awasho, Upper Keshelun and Shemona Metelo. Mount Bor,
              which is 2939 meters above sea level, is the largest mountain in
              the district.
            </p>

              The top of the mountain clearly shows the neighboring zones in all
              four directions, namely Gurgaon, Hadiya and Kenbata hard zones, as
              well as several areas of the Jima zone, as well as the Gelgilgbe
              No. 1 Hydroelectric Power Dam and other locations.

              The fact that the annual medicinal harvest is held on the same Bor
              mountain, where the members of the nation come out together and
              collect medicine from various plants, makes it special. This
              annual medicinal harvest takes place on October 17 every year.
              Most of the community harvests the plants used for medicine on
              this mountain, and the reason for this is that the first morning
              sun is found in this place. It is because the medicines found on
              the mountain are believed to have high healing power. The medicine
              that is picked and flavored in the year is called "Samo Eta" in
              the local pronunciation. Local residents collect leaves, roots and
              bark from many types of plants on the mountain and take them home
              and prepare them properly and taste them as medicine for humans
              and animals.
