              boiled, the mother of the family goes to the backyard and the
              family goes to the front and disperses them in their own
              yard.Unless the day is a fasting day, the family brings a basket

            </p>
            <h3> Hebo festival and Demera ceremony</h3>
            <p>
              A week before the demera ceremony, men go to the forest to cut
              wood for demera. When they go to the woodcutter they are dancing
              to the sound of the tuturu /trumpet/ made of horn. The sum is
              added to two places. After one of them is laid out on the communal
              dance floor to dry, on September 16th, the day called Ametu will
              be assembled into a small and a large one. The other one is joined
              by a group of young people at each door and torches are lit from
              each house between 12:30 and 1:00 on the day. At this time, "Dasin
              Maka Kes, Maka Kesfan Gawa Girun" means get out of the closet
              hungry and enter full. Again they say "Midasin Maka Kesfan Gawa
              Girun" which means let hunger come out of the rock and satiety
              come in.By moving the torch fire around the pantry, cattle shed
              and sleeping area, they dance the Yahoya-Yahoya group dance to the
              place where the village gathers. The total will be lit. Finally,
              after graduation, seniors return to their homes for dinner. After
              returning to their homes, all the family and relatives gather and
              eat the food prepared for the occasion. Then later, when it's time
              to go to bed, butter is added. Everyone sleeps with the blessed
              butter on their feet and body. He wakes up before nine o'clock in
              the night and goes to the kancha, making the sound of the
              tururu/trumpet/ and dancing the little demera to the kuso. As soon
              as others hear the sound of the tururu, they light torches from
              their houses and gather for the second time at the demera place
              where the kancha is joined together. They dance "Yahoya, Yahoya".
              Demera is lit and the dance continues till two o'clock.
            </p>

            <h3> Esonsi Fina / Hebo Festival / First day</h3>
            <p>
              September 17 is the first day of the Hebo festival. In every
              nation's culture, from this day onwards, it is called Esonsi Fina
              or the first Fina. That being said, it is counted until the
              thirtieth of September. Fina is a folk wind instrument made of
              bamboo and has different sizes. The scan is also different. Only
              during the Hebo festival is he seen in a beautiful state. The
              musical instrument is a national musical instrument that is played
              by all participants, from children to adult women.
            </p>

            <h3> Fareni Otu / Good Wishes Statement /</h3>
            <p>
              In every nation, the Hebo festival is a time when friends and
              relatives greet each other, express good wishes and enjoy the food
              prepared for the festival together. Every year, friends and
              relatives have a fixed day where they ask each other. This day
              cannot be missed. Even if there is a problem, someone has to go
              and explain the situation. This greeting begins on the day of the
              "Isonsi Fina" Hebo festival.
            </p>
            <p>
              On this day, children go to their friends and relatives with some
              of the goto pils they have prepared in advance for the festival.
              They bring the goto pils to the house and put the pils next to the
              stove and pole, expressing their good wishes saying "Chfaso Maark
              Kepsania" / Did you drink the drink safely. At this time, the
              family of the house and the mother-in-law say "Ushanis Gor
              Wotauto" / May God bless you. They express their joy. This
              exchange of greetings and greetings with friends and family during
              the Bohe Festival is called "Pharni Otu" flower exchange.
            </p>
            <h2>Boga game system</h2>
            <p>
              The game of Boga has its own system. No one moves at random. A
              bogey game leader is elected to conduct the game according to the
              rules. This leader is called "Abamila" in the national language.
              Father Mila will lead by giving instructions so that there is no
              conflict in the middle of the game, so that the children do not
              spoil the order of the game by ignorance, whose house the game
              starts at, what time it should start and what time it should end,
              so that the reception in each house is done in an orderly manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until the end of the Hebo festival, all the local community
              gathers at the place where it is played every year or at the place
              called Kancha /Kancha/ in the language of the nation, the Boga
              players /boga players/ gather with their necessary materials. They
              make a beautiful melody with the sound of the tuturu/horn until
              they are many. Everyone in every house hears this sound and
              gathers out of their houses and the fathers and great men who are
              decorated with shields and tiger skins lead the game in a zigzag
              procession.
            </p>
            <p>
              While playing in the rafters of the house, children are behind the
              elders in front, and together they say woo, woo for a short time
              and make the sound of trumpets. By beating with their som (bamboo
              rod) they say woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo,
              woo, woo, woo, woo. After playing in this way, the traditional
              drink / Borde / Mausha / and Magr Kobena will be served. After
              they eat and drink, they are given butter to anoint their heads.
              "Gor wotauto, wonets ynets katauto, mias fufna futu kontefau" and
              "Gor Hebo Lord bless you, give you year after year, may your
              cattle be born and multiply like sand."The game played in this way
              lasts till 9 o'clock and then they return to the kancha where the
              joint game is played. On the first day of the game of Boga, the
              elders of the country wear traditional bulko or gabi and carry
              spears in the communal game area /kancha/ waiting for the bogeymen
              /boga players/ to return from house to house. After they arrive,
              they shout together and play a certain "Yahoo" game, then they go
              to the place where the "Komsu" ceremony is held, taking their
              phino (wind instrument) and singing along with the governors.
            </p>
            <p>
              The "Fino" which is blown during the Hebo festival is kept on the
              kancha/dancing place/ till the end of the festival. Even if
              someone wants to skip the game, he will leave his fino under the
              tree where he sits. On the day the Hebo festival game is over, a
              person is chosen to keep the fino safe and bring it back in the
              year. Keeping all this in mind, the Hebo festival is given special
              consideration and will be celebrated until the beginning of
              October, coinciding with the Cross Festival celebrated on
              September 17.
